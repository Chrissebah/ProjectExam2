# Project Exam 2 </br>

My final exam for year 2 of Noroff Frontend Development.

## Description:
This is my final exam. I made my main focus on making the react work. Despite my lack of knowledge as we only recently learnt about this form of frontend development, I thought that this was the best way to prove that I could use it successfully. For what I can tell from my thorough testing is that it works as intended. However the sign up process seems to be somewhat bugged but I am unable to replicate it. I had someone help me and they receieved an error but when refreshing the page it seemed to be fixed so I am unsure as to what that is.
